Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning with MATLAB
This project aimed at developing a comprehensive system for analyzing and classifying human activities using MATLAB. By leveraging the power of signal processing and machine learning algorithms, we created a robust framework capable of identifying and categorizing different human movements from sensor data. The goal was to achieve high accuracy in recognizing activities such as walking, running, sitting, and standing, which has vast applications in healthcare monitoring, sports analysis, and interactive gaming.
